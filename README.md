Dodge is a minimalistic 2D side scroller for android in which the player must avoid incoming obstacles.

# Setting up environment

If you are planning on building with AIDE, [take a look here](http://www.android-ide.com/). Otherwise, set up a project and import the sources using [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html).

## Disclaimer

This game was written rather quickly on a mobile device and as a result, the code quality suffers greatly.
